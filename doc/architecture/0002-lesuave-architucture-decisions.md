## Context

LeSuave is a platform service, connecting buyers to sellers.

LeSuave is in it's early days, and we want to test the idea, if it's something the market wants or needs
We are still in the Explore phase (Kent Beck's 3X), most decision will change later on.

Architecture design of LeSuave.

Tech stack:
- Ruby on Rails
- Webservices API
- IOS App
- Heroku [Explore phase]

## Decision

Proof of concept.
Test the idea.

We want to be quick to market, launching products and features quick enough to fail fast.
We want quick onboarding, and the ability to quickly upskill.
We want to be able to able to use trusted libraries in order to decrease development time.
We want to develop what is unique to us, and configure what isn't i.e. login.

## Consequences

Ruby on Rails framework.
